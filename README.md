Android application 

Developed an android application in java which helps the user in dictating the behavior of the phone on certain situations like certain time of a day or particular location. User can change his cell phone settings like from whom he should get call from, silent mode in offices, wifi access when user enters college etc. I implemented the part of location and google maps. I used Great circle distance algorithm to find distance between two locations. I implemented modules to check whether there is any setting on the phone for that particular location and given range. I implemented the module to check when the settings should be changed, when user enters or exits from the location. I implemented a module for extracting location coordinates from the map for the location which user wants.
